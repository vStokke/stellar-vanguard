## Information We Collect

**We do not directly collect, store, or transmit any personal information from our users.** However, the Game integrates third-party services that may collect certain data as described below.

### Locally Stored Data

Game save data (progress, settings, and pilot profiles) is stored locally on your device in encrypted form. This data is never transmitted to us or any third party.

### Data Collected by Third-Party Services

The following third-party services operate within the Game and may collect data according to their own privacy policies:

This data may be used by Google to serve personalized or non-personalized advertisements depending on your device consent settings.
